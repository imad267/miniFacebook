User Requirements
High level requirements that describe what a user can achieve. These are the needs that the system fulfil, 
similar to business requirements

U1. Users can post a textual update of their current mood or status.

U2. Users can choose whether the post described in U1 is shared with Friends, Everyone, or Nobody other than themselves.

U3. Users are presented with a list of posts made by people they are friends with or posts that are made to Everyone (see U2).

U4. The posts that appear in the lists U3 are filtered to only contain those that the user will find relevant or interesting

U5. The posts that appear in the lists U3 are ordered so that those the user will find highly relevant, and have not been 
seen previously by the user are towards the top of the list.
