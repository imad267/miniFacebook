More and more individuals and organizations pay attention to identifying social media as the tools to
support knowledge sharing. They try to use much more functions of social media to perform knowledge sharing behaviors, 
such as the functions of posting, chatting, creating groups.

not developed only for knowledge sharing. Therefore, it has limitations to use social media functions to support knowledge 
sharing. This gives us the motivation to examine the functional and non-functional requirements of social media that relate 
to supporting knowledge sharing.
