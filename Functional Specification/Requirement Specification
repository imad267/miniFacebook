Functional Requirements

Functional requirements provide highly specific details that allow designers, developers and testers to create a system to 
meet precise specifications. I've mapped them to user requirements file

Social media are computer-mediated tools, and
social media can be taken as high interactive
platform for people to create, share and exchange
information, knowledge, and other resources [1, 2].
Functional requirements describe what the
software system should do. The functional
requirements mainly are the statements of the
services that the system should provide, how the
system react to inputs, and how the system should
behave in some particular situations.


F1. Posts can be 63,206 characters long. [ref U1]

F2. Posts can be contain unicode characters. [ref U1]

F3. Posts may not contain any any of the following formatting, other than what can be provided by unicode characters - 
bold, strikethrough, underline [ref U1]

F4. 80% or more of posts in a users' post list (U3) should be from their friends. The remaining posts can be public posts 
or sponsored posts.



Non Functional Requirements
qualities and characteristics of the system that are not features. Again can be mapped to user or functional requirements

N1. After submitting a post through the web interface (see U1), it will be available to appear to in other users' 
lists of posts (see U3) within 30 seconds for 90% of posts.

N2. An update to a users list of posts (either the initial view of a list, or an extension to the list when scrolling to 
the bottom) appears in 3 seconds for 90% of users.

N3. 50% of users can post a status update within 1 minute of starting to try and post without having used the application 
before or receiving help.
